This is a set of tools that I am creating as part of Makefield.org

Author: Mike Festa

Currently, there is just one file: tools.py, which has some helper functions for blender

INSTALL:
Clone into {blender_dir}/scripts/models/makefield

USE:
In Blender (script or console)
from makefield import tools
